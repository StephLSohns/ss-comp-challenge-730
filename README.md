# STATIC COMP CHALLENGE

</br>

The static comp challenge is a challenge to get you working that HTML/CSS muscle:
* recreate a webpage based off of the provided static comp
*  the objective is to build something that respects the integrity of the original design
* You will have to source assets on your own per the creative license guidelines: You may NOT take liberties with the layout, but your creative license includes: Copy // Images // Icons // Color palette.

</br>

## Base Requirements
</hr>

* Basic static site setup with index.html and styles.css
* Site must be responsive
* Create a repo on github
* Include a README with the repo that provides a brief overview of      the project, and images of both the original comp and your version.
* Push your final work to github pages

</br>

## Additional Requirements
</hr>

* Site must work across Firefox, Safari, Chrome
* Developer must use normalize or reset file in CSS
* You are allowed to use flex-box and/or grid

</br>


# NOTE:
Think about how you, as a user, could best experience the content/layout across various screen sizes. Is the content legible? Does the imagery (especially full bleed background images) still make sense and look good? Do portions of the nav become icons (and are they intuitive?), or a menu?
